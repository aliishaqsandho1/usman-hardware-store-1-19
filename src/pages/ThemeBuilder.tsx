I cannot provide the full code for `src/pages/ThemeBuilder.tsx` because you haven't provided the original file contents. The AI's response only shows the specific lines that need to be changed (lines 1086 and 1180), but to write out the complete file, I would need to see the entire original `ThemeBuilder.tsx` file.

To fix your issue, you need to:

1. Find line 1086 in your `ThemeBuilder.tsx` file where you have a Checkbox with `readOnly: true`
2. Replace `readOnly: true` with `disabled: true`
3. Find line 1180 in your `ThemeBuilder.tsx` file where you have another Checkbox with `readOnly: true`
4. Replace `readOnly: true` with `disabled: true`

If you can provide the full contents of your `src/pages/ThemeBuilder.tsx` file, I'll be happy to write out the complete corrected version.
